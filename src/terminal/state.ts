/**
 * Classify claude's TUI screen into a coarse state, from clean emulator text.
 *
 * "ready" means the session is genuinely done and can take the NEXT instruction —
 * the main prompt is idle AND nothing is in flight. A session that spawned
 * background agents sits at its idle input box WHILE those agents run; that is NOT
 * ready — prompting it ("merge now") just gets "can't, agents still running",
 * spinning forever. So WORKING (the main turn generating OR background agents
 * running) is checked BEFORE the idle box: the "esc to interrupt" / "↓ N tokens"
 * chrome is present exactly while work is in flight and gone once it's done.
 * Tuned against Claude Code v2.1.x. Conservative: unsure → "unknown".
 *   - GATE:    permission/selection dialog ("Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel",
 *              "Do you want to proceed?", highlighted "❯ 1.").
 *   - WORKING: work in flight — a spinner or background agents. Markers (TUI
 *              chrome, not assistant prose): "esc to interrupt", a "↓ N tokens"
 *              counter. WAIT; don't advance.
 *   - READY:   idle prompt with nothing running — its hint shows "? for shortcuts",
 *              "shift+tab to cycle", or "/effort", and NO in-flight chrome.
